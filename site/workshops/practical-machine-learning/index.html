						</div>

						<p style="font-size:x-large;">Get started withg Machine Learning with <em>6 evening sessions,</em> where you'll learn how to use Machine Learning to solve real problems.</p>

						<p>We'll walk through several common problems and use Machine Learning techniques to solve them. This will give us a great understanding of the concepts as well as a good overview of the available tools and libraries available.</p>

						<p>We'll be using a variety of languages and libraries, including the popular TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. Well also spend some time looking at the major open source libraries available and their specific strength and weaknesses, so you'll know exactly what to pikcc up for your next project.</p>

						<h4>Is this for you?</h4>
						<p>Are you a developer dealing with data on a daily basis? Can you and your company benefit from predicting what your customers will do? Are you interested in keeping your skills up to date and relevant? Do you face complex problems and could do with smarter software solutions?</p>

						<p>With the wealth of available information on Machine Learning, it's sometimes hard to figure out where to start. There are so many projects and libraries available, with sometimes incomplete or missing documentation. We'll take a look at the best tools and use them to solve real problems, so you'll walk away able to face Machine Learning challenges with confindence.</p>
						<h4>What if I know some things already?</h4>
						<p>Before the course begins, we'll ask you to give us an overview of what you know already, and we'll make sure that the task you're set will stretch and challenge you without being overwhelming. If you want to discuss your particular circumstances with us, reach out at <a href="mailto:workshops@decacoder.com">workshops@decacoder.com</a>.</p>
						<h4>What you'll learn</h4>
						<p>The curriculum will include</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An introduction to Machine Learning concepts</li>
							<li>Recommending products with Support Vector Machines</li>
							<li>Segmenting customers using clustering algorithms</li>
							<li>Recognising images with Artificial Neural Networks</li>
							<li>Sorting documents using Natural Language Processing and Classification</li>
							<li>Applying Machine Learning to your application</li>
							<li>BONUS: Predicting software delivery date using a Monte Carlo simulation</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>How does it work?<br></h4>
						<p>In a typical session we will start with a presentation or demonstration of a new topic, after which you'll get a chance to try things out for yourself with the help of the instructor. Before we finish the evening, we'll share the best resources available elsewhere about this topic and set project tasks for the next session.</p>
						<p>In between sessions you'll be able to talk with each other and with the instructors online, including an online code clinic google hangout once a week.</p>
						<h4>When and Where?</h4>
						<p>Times: The course will run every Monday evening for 6 weeks. 6:00-8:30pm The first session will be on the 24th of October and the last session will be on the 28th of November.</p>
						<p>We recommend you set some additional time aside to make the most of the course, but if that's not possible, we have made the sessions self contained enough to stand alone. You'll also have access to all the course material for reference after the course is over.</p>
